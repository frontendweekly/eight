## [Reeder 5](https://reeder.app/)

RSS has never died for me and Reeder has been my RSS reader since.
I use [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) to manage feeds.

## [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)

I’m writing this on iA Writer.

## [Scapple](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scapple/overview)

My ideas are chaos at the best, but Scapple helps me see the relationship.

## [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

I don’t like Dock. Alfred has been helping me not use it for very long time.

## [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/)

I love CLI but for some reason, I use GUI for git and Sublime Merge is good fit for me.

## [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/)

A Swiss Army knife for screenshots. I wish CleanShot allows me to upload images.

## [Retrobatch](https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/)

Very flexible and powerful batch image process tool.

## [xScope](https://xscopeapp.com/)

When you do designing in the browser, you’d want to consider having xScope in your tool chain.
